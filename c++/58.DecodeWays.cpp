/*91. Decode Ways
You have intercepted a secret message encoded as a string of numbers. The
message is decoded via the following mapping:

"1" -> 'A'

"2" -> 'B'

...

"25" -> 'Y'

"26" -> 'Z'

However, while decoding the message, you realize that there are many different
ways you can decode the message because some codes are contained in other codes
("2" and "5" vs "25").

For example, "11106" can be decoded into:

"AAJF" with the grouping (1, 1, 10, 6)
"KJF" with the grouping (11, 10, 6)
The grouping (1, 11, 06) is invalid because "06" is not a valid code (only "6"
is valid). Note: there may be strings that are impossible to decode.

Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it.
If the entire string cannot be decoded in any valid way, return 0. The test
cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.


Example 1:
Input: s = "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).

Example 2:
Input: s = "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: "226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2
6).

Example 3:
Input: s = "06"
Output: 0
Explanation:"06" cannot be mapped to "F" because of the leading zero ("6" is
different from "06"). In this case, the string is not a valid encoding, so
return 0.


Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 100
s contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).

// Logic:
/*
dp[i]=dp[i+1]+dp[i+2]
make a tree like

121->
    121
    / \
   1   12
  / \    \
 2  21    1
/
1

for double digit start with 1, any no can be taken
but if start with 2 then 2nd digit b/w 0-6

else nothing will work with anyother starting

2 decision at every step -> 2^n complexity

how many diff ways can we decode subproblem

Iterative way:
use an array 'dp' to store number of ways to decode the string up to index i
checks if a substring of 2 characters forms a valid decoding (between 1 and 26),
and if so, it adds the number of ways to decode the rest of the string. dp[0]
holds the total number of ways to decode the entire string


Recursive way:
dfs function uses recursion with memoization to compute the number of ways to
decode the string starting from index i. If a solution for i has already been
computed, it returns the cached value. Similar logic is applied as in the
iterative approach: handle '0', check if two characters can form a valid
encoding, and recurse on the rest of the string. The base case is that if you
reach the end of the string, there is one way to decode it (doing nothing).
